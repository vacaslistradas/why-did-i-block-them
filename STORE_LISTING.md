Why Did I Block Them?

## Short Description (132 characters max)
Remember why you blocked someone on Twitter/X. Save the tweet, categorize the reason, and never forget why you hit that block button.

## Detailed Description

Ever blocked someone on Twitter and weeks later wondered "wait, why did I block this person?"

**Why Did I Block Them?** solves this problem by letting you record your reasons right when you block someone.

### How It Works

1. Block someone on Twitter/X as you normally would
2. A popup appears asking why you blocked them
3. Pick a category and add optional notes
4. That's it! The extension remembers so you don't have to

### Features

**Capture the moment** — When you block from a tweet, the extension automatically saves that tweet's text so you remember exactly what triggered the block.

**Categorize your blocks** — Choose from built-in categories like Political, Harassment, Misinformation, Trolling, and more. Or create your own custom categories.

**See reminders** — Visit a blocked user's profile? A banner reminds you why you blocked them and shows the original tweet if available.

**Search & manage** — Browse your entire block list, search by username or reason, and delete records you no longer need.

**Syncs across devices** — Your block reasons sync across all Chrome browsers where you're logged into your Google account.

**Private by design** — All data stays on your device. Nothing is sent to external servers. See our privacy policy for details.

### Perfect For

- People who block frequently and lose track of why
- Anyone who's ever unblocked someone only to remember (too late) why they blocked them
- Users who want to keep their Twitter/X experience peaceful and organized

### Note

This extension requires access to twitter.com and x.com to detect blocks and display reminders. It does not access any other websites.
