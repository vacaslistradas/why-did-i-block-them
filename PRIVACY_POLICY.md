# Privacy Policy for "Why Did I Block Them?"

**Last updated: January 18, 2026**

## Overview

"Why Did I Block Them?" is a Chrome extension that helps you remember why you blocked someone on Twitter/X. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how your data is handled.

## Data Collection

This extension collects and stores the following information **only when you block someone on Twitter/X**:

- The username of the blocked account
- The category you select (e.g., "Political", "Harassment")
- Any notes you add about why you blocked them
- The text of the tweet that triggered the block (if blocking from a tweet)
- The URL of that tweet
- The date of the block

## Data Storage

**All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage system.** Specifically:

- Data is saved using `chrome.storage.sync`, which means it syncs across your Chrome browsers where you're signed into the same Google account
- This sync is handled entirely by Google Chrome, not by us
- **No data is ever sent to our servers** — we don't have any servers
- **No data is shared with third parties**

## Data Access

- The extension only runs on twitter.com and x.com
- The extension cannot access any other websites or browser data

## Data Deletion

You have full control over your data:

- Delete individual block records from the extension popup
- Clear all data by removing the extension
- Manage Chrome sync data through your Google account settings

## Third-Party Services

This extension does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Permissions Explained
